## Origin

I originally began developing a watchface for Dexcom/Diabetic users (I am Type 1 Diabetic).

During development, I learned the Garmin SDK does not allow a Watch Face app to access the
[Dexcom Data Field](https://apps.garmin.com/en-US/apps/9040cc1d-13de-4d48-a859-6c2a0cedec3e)

This is sad (I reached out to both Dexcom & Garmin. Received no response). 

Irregardless, I spent too much time w/ the Garmin SDK to not publish something. 

While looking over API Documentation, I noticed the [pushDistance](https://developer.garmin.com/connect-iq/api-docs/Toybox/ActivityMonitor/Info.html#pushDistance-var) field. I found zero results for 'Wheelchair' or 'Wheel Chair' in the Garmin IQ Connect Store (Diabetes/Dexcom doesn't have many options neither). 

My goal is for one download & one positive review :)
